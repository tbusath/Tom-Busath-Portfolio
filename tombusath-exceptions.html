                <h1 style="margin-top: 80px;">Rebel Exceptions - A Complex Process Made Easy Through Design</h1>
                <p>Optimizing a critical workflow to improve efficiency and drive significant financial results.</p>

                <section>
                    <h2>Project Summary</h2>
                    <p>This project focused on redesigning the exception process for Capital One Auto Finance's Rebel underwriting tool.  As Lead Product Designer, I aimed to streamline a cumbersome process that was hindering loan approvals and negatively impacting revenue.</p>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
                    <p>Underwriters at Capital One Auto Finance were approving only about 10% of credit policy exceptions each month.  These 'exception' loans were still profitable, but the process to grant them was too time-consuming, frustrating Relationship Managers (RMs), and causing delays for dealers.  Key problems included:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Managing exception requests and responses via email was inefficient and difficult to track.</li>
                        <li>Writing up exception requests and approvals was time-consuming.</li>
                        <li>Underwriting exceptions caused frustration for dealers.</li>
                        <li>Timely approval of expiring MEMAs (loan approvals) was critical.</li>
                        <li>There was no good way to track and manage system issues related to exceptions.</li>
                        <li>Audits of exceptions were strictly enforced, requiring thorough documentation.</li>
                        <li>Compliance concerns existed regarding the quality of exception approval documentation.</li>
                        <li>Certain structural changes did not require re-approval, raising further compliance issues.</li>
                        <li>RMs were spending an average of 2.5 hours waiting for exception approval.</li>
                        <li>Approvers were spending an average of 8.5 minutes on each exception.</li>
                    </ul>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h2>Empathy Research & Insights</h2>
                    <p>I began by reviewing insights from Product Designers (PdMs) who had previously worked on exceptions.  I also conducted further research to gain a deeper understanding of the challenges faced by users.</p>
                    <h3>Key Insights:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>RMs found it tedious to locate all the necessary details for exception requests, and case requirements were often unrelated to the specific exception.</li>
                        <li>RMs struggled to know who could respond most quickly to their requests, leading to delays and wasted time.</li>
                        <li>Managers found it time-consuming to gather all the relevant metrics needed to make informed decisions on exceptions.</li>
                    </ul>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h2>Service Blueprinting</h2>
                    <p>I facilitated blueprinting sessions with Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) from underwriting and funding teams to map out the current and future state of the exception process.  My PdM and I alternated between documenting the blueprint and facilitating the discussions.</p>
                    <h3>Key Activities and Outcomes:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Created current and future state blueprints for both Underwriting Exceptions and Funding Exceptions to ensure all stakeholders were aligned.</li>
                        <li>Focused initially on Underwriting Exceptions, as this was the immediate priority.</li>
                        <li>Invited SMEs to ensure accurate documentation of all steps and pain points.</li>
                        <li>Documented the current state blueprint and then, in a subsequent workshop, created the future state blueprint.</li>
                        <li>Defined the main goal: to make the process easier and faster for underwriters.</li>
                        <li>Used the blueprints to guide the creation of wireframes and the final UI design for Rebel.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <div class="image-container">
                         <p>Future state blueprint created in a workshop</p>
                    </div>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h2>Wireframes & Prototyping</h2>
                    <p>After the discovery phase, I created wireframes to test and validate potential solutions.</p>
                    <h3>Key Activities and Outcomes:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Created low-fidelity digital wireframes in Balsamiq to focus on flow and functionality over visual details.</li>
                        <li>Exported wireframes to interactive PDFs for easy click-through and stakeholder alignment.</li>
                        <li>Used wireframes for both stakeholder alignment and user testing.</li>
                         <li>Created 3 wireframes for different exception types before creating a "worst-case scenario" wireframe to test a linear flow for all exceptions.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <div class="image-container">
                         <p>Wireframe prototype used for testing</p>
                    </div>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h2>UI Design & Implementation</h2>
                    <p>After usability testing, I designed the final screens in Sketch and prototyped them in InVision.</p>
                    <h3>Key Design Decisions:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Consolidated all information needed to make an exception case, eliminating the need for multiple modals and clicks.  RMs, as power users, appreciated having all necessary data readily available.</li>
                        <li>Adhered to the Rebel style guide to ensure UI consistency.</li>
                        <li>Designed the solution for desktop use.</li>
                        <li>This consolidated information design was the most praised feature in Rebel.</li>
                        <li>This was the first phase of exception simplification, with the next phase focused on requesting and routing exceptions.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <div class="image-container">
                         <p>Medium exception - High fidelity</p>
                         <p>Executive exception - High fidelity</p>
                         <p>Self-approving a Medium-level exception</p>
                    </div>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h2>Results & Impact</h2>
                    <p>The redesigned exception process had a significant positive impact:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Achieved 86% 'Satisfied' or 'Very Satisfied' rating in user surveys.</li>
                        <li>Ranked as the #3 most praised aspect of the Rebel tool.</li>
                        <li>Increased exception usage by 286%, generating millions of dollars in annual net present value (NPV).</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>A Relationship Manager stated in an NPS survey: "I love being able to make exceptions at ease."</p>
