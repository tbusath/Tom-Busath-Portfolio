                <p>Designing an intelligent system to optimize loan application processing and drive significant revenue growth.</p>

                <section>
                    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
                    <p>SmartQueues is an AI-driven feature within the Rebel platform that I helped design. It sorts loan applications based on their probability of funding, enabling Relationship Managers to prioritize their efforts effectively. This case study details the design process, my contributions, and the impact of SmartQueues.</p>

                <section>
                    <h2>The Challenge: Inefficient Loan Prioritization</h2>
                    <p>Relationship Managers at Capital One Auto Finance faced a significant challenge in managing their workload. They had time to proactively contact only a small fraction of incoming loan applications, and lacked a data-driven approach to prioritize their outreach. This resulted in:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Limited Contact Rate: RMs could only call about 8% of loan applications.</li>
                        <li>Inconsistent Strategies: RMs used varying, often subjective, methods to determine which applications to pursue.</li>
                        <li>Low Funding Rate: Only 23% of deals worked on by RMs were eventually funded.</li>
                        <li>Missed Opportunities: Many potentially profitable loans were not being pursued.</li>
                    </ul>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h2>The Solution: SmartQueues</h2>
                    <p>To address these challenges, we developed SmartQueues, an AI-powered system that analyzes loan applications and predicts their likelihood of funding. This enables RMs to focus on the most promising opportunities, improving efficiency and increasing revenue.</p>

                    <h2>My Role in the Design Process</h2>
                    <p>I played a key role in the design and implementation of SmartQueues, collaborating with a cross-functional team of 10 people. My contributions included:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>User Research:</strong> I conducted empathy research with 7 Relationship Managers to understand their workflows, pain points, and decision-making processes.</li>
                        <li><strong>Data Collaboration:</strong> I worked closely with data analysts to synthesize research insights and understand the capabilities of the AI model.</li>
                        <li><strong>Design Implementation:</strong> I translated the AI model's output into a user-friendly interface within Rebel, including:
                            <ul>
                                <li>SmartQueues Toggle: A switch to enable/disable SmartQueues.</li>
                                <li>Probability Indicator: A visual representation of the funding probability for each application.</li>
                                 <li>Deal Linking:  Ability to link related deals.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>User-Centered Design:</strong> I ensured that the design was intuitive, efficient, and aligned with the needs of Relationship Managers.</li>
                    </ul>
